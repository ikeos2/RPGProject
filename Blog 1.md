# Welcome
This is the first post on my attempt at building an online role playing game! 

So far all here's a quick demo of what I've got;

Breaking this down - we have a lot going on! 

Lately, I've been working on getting the cameras to work better. For perspective, Unity begins a project with a simple camera object. This camera object is pretty much a dumb camera, point it at something and it shows you it! no smooth transitions, nothing to crazy. Simple, quick, and easy. However, this means if I wanted to do anything, such as smoothly sliding from one view point to another you will have to write code to move it!

Being a fairly common problem with Unity, they released a package called "Cinemachine", a camera that manages a lot of that for you! So now as you can see in the gif above we have fairly smooth follower camera.

The current problem I face is user camera drag. Here's an example of the type of movement I'm looking for:

Spoiler: you're going to see a lot of WoW screenshots because that's the gold standard for MMORPG's. 

I'm pretty annoyed with what I've been working on regarding the camera spinning so while I understand what I want to do, I'm going to put this on pause for now.

Top things on my todo list now:
* [ ] Figure out networking
* [ ] Figure out a story?
* [ ] Get NPC animations to play
	* [ ] Casting animations, on hit animations, death animations
* [x] Start a  blog
